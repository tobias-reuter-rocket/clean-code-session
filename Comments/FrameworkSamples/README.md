# Comments and why to avoid them

## Robert C. Martin, Clean Code

 - comments lie, truth is only in the code
 - requirements may change, old comments are confusing
 - hard to keep them up to date
 - commenting stuff often means not being able to express ideas in the code



## Good comments
 - copyright
 - annotations: type hints and returns (not in PHP7), explaining some values (like expected array format)
 - explaining eg. regexes
 - explaining "strange" code
 - warning ("method not optimized for batch input, only use for a single entity")
 - emphisizing ("trim() is REALLY important here, see ISSUE-1234")
 - TODO
 - documenting an external API



## Bad comments
  - gibberish (comment different than what function does, comment giving more questions than answers, "I hate Alice and Bob")
  - redundant repeating function's content (property name repeated)
  - information noise (autogenerated "Class contructor"...)
  - change log
  - structuring comments, if it get's so complicated that you need to do this, it's a sign to refactor


    while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
        ...
    } //while



  - commented out code (!!!)
  - non-local comments:


    // Default: 8082
    public void setFitnessePort(int fitnessePort)


  - TMI - like explaining base64
  - position markers


### example of good refactoring:
    // Checking, if, employee is elegigle for full benefits
    if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65))
        versus:
    if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())


### example of redundance:
    /**
     * Returns the day of the month
     *
     * @return int the day of the month
     */
    public int getDayOfMonth() {
      return dayOfMonth;
    }
